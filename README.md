# Nao & ageing
## project discription 

#### The proposed project addresses risk-factors that can pose barriers to healthy ageing, including a sedentary lifestyle and feelings of loneliness through the use of socially assistive robots (SARs) programmed to support a healthier, more active lifestyle (i.e., active ageing). 

#### The aim of this project is to utilize technology to help older adults experience healthier ageing, providing them with a SAR in a goal setting program along with mentoring, with the intent to decrease the risk and effects of age-related disabilities. At first, the acceptability and likeability of Nao (SAR) will be evaluated through interaction sessions between the participants and Nao. Second, we plan to implement a quasi-experimental research design using a goal setting program delivered and monitored by Nao (SAR) to examine its preliminary effectiveness. The goal setting program will consist of Nao being trained by the project staff to interview older adults to set their own physical activity goals based on their interest in an individualized manner (i.e., individual choices and preferences for physical activities). Subsequently, the participants will receive a daily plan by Nao. Their progress will be monitored regularly, including the provision of visual real-time feedback.   

#### The project’s specific objectives are:  
•	 Exploring likeability and acceptability Nao by older adults  
•	 Enhancing the physical activities of older adults;  
•	 Decreasing the feeling of loneliness among older adults.  

#### This study is conducted in two phases:  
1.	During the first phase, we will explore the acceptability and likeability of the SAR by older adults through interaction sessions between the participants and the SAR.  
2.	The second phase is quasi-experimental study to explore the preliminary effectiveness of using the Nao robot to enhance physical activity and reduce loneliness in older adults.
