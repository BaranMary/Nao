# Nao's scripts

Script preparation for phases 1 and 2. The required scripts for Nao to interact with the participants and for the intervention sessions (including interviews with  the users using the Bangor Goal-Setting Interview (BGSI) followed by the provision of a reciprocal interaction and daily conversations leading to physical activities goal setting) will be developed. 

*The scripts here can be be written by both psychologists and engineers to be programmed/coded by our engineer project partners.*

For both phases of study, we will use the following process. The scripts for reciprocal interactions are developed for greeting, *fixed questions* for all users (e.g., regarding hobbies, friends, family members, memories, routines), *conditional questions/person focused items* that are based on each person stated responses to the fixed questions (e.g., if a person says they are interested in art, the next question is about the type of art, favourite artist and so on). Once the information from both questions types are collected, more tailored scripts about each response is provided, such as information about a specific interest or possible talk about shared memories. The same format will be done for Bangor interview questions that includes fixed and conditional questions/items. Meanwhile, the SAR is programmed for different modules, including *motion detection*, *face and emotion recognition* as well as *speech interaction* so that it can recognize the users’ faces, voices and speech. 

## **Greeting** 
[Nao has some greetings functions so we need to add to its knowledge base]
- [ ] Hello!

- [ ] How are you?  
  - OR How's going?
  - OR How's your feeling today?

 
    
## **Introduction**
- [ ] Nao introduces itself [we can use current Nao's introduction in its knowledge base] 
  
- [ ] Nao asks the users to introduce themselves: 
  - Can I ask your name?
  - OR what is your name?
  - OR can you tell me your name?
  - OR  
  
## **Fixed questions about their interests/hobbies**
what do you do in your free time? [Nao should recognize a keyword and ask following conditional questions]

## **Conditional questions about their interests/hobbies**



## Fixed questions about family member/friends/memories


## **Conditional questions about family member/friends/memories**
