# Nao's scripts

## First step: greeting and introduction
- [ ] Nao introduces itself and also Nao can teach users how they can communicate with it (like tapping its head at start and ath the end of conversation).
- [ ]  Nao can talk about weather [to give some time to user feel more comfortable]. 
- [ ] Nao asks the users to introduce themselves: 
  - Can I ask your name? / What is your name? / Can you tell me your name? / May I have your name?
  - Nao will save user's name

## Second step:  Nao can ask user a general question like: how the user spent their week/weekend/day

## Third step:  Nao can ask user about their interests/hobbies

for example, tell users do you feel fine, or happy or bored, or sad, or relaxed or excited...
 

## Sixth questions about what they like to see from Nao to do --Nao can describr what it can do at the introduction or here 

## Seventh questions about participants preferences [if we can include the following questions that would be great]
- [ ] As you know my name is Nao. do you like to change my name? do you have any suggestions?
- [ ] Do you like to have a robot? if so, are you interested in having me?
- [ ] Do you prefer me to have clothes on or do you think I am fine?
- [ ] What things do you like a robot to do for you? after they reply, then we can ask which activities you like to get help from a robot? reminding you to take medications or about important dates like birthdays of your friends, doing chores, finding information, reading books, helping in bathing
- [ ] Do you like me helping you in planning for your days? like setting goals?
- [ ] Do you like to do exercises together?
- [ ] Do you enjoy talking to me? if so, what topics do you like more to talk about?  
- [ ] Is there anything you think I need to improve in myself?

## Minnesota slangs  
We can add this slang list in any above conversation.
- _Oh, for cute_! = Adorable [a way of emphasizing it. “Oh, for fun!”, “Oh, for sure”, “Oh for cute”.]
- _Uff-da_ = Oh! [Uff da can be used to express surprise, relief, exhaustion, astonishment, and dismay]
- _You betcha_ = Agreement
- _Holy buckets_ = Jeez Louise [ike “Jeez Louise” or “For crying out loud.”]
- _Budge_ = Skip the line
- _Skol_ = Cheers!/Game chant [This Norwegian word actually means “cheers” and “to good health.”]
- _Duck, Duck, Gray Duck_ = Duck, Duck, Goose
- _Hotdish, Juicy Lucy, Lutefisk_: these foods (Minnesotan) are Nao's favorite foods. Nao can add: "I also love creamy chicken and wild rice soup."
- _Minnesota Nice_: (Phrase): A general belief that people in Minnesota are nicer or more polite than your average American.[Nao can say: I like Minnesota as they say the midwest are Minnesotan nice]
- _Minnesotan Good-Bye_: (Phrase): Minnesotans will often announce they are going to leave, then spend several minutes talking at the door, then spend another several minutes talking out on the porch, then spend another several minutes talking at their car door before actually leaving.[Example: Nao at the end say good-bye and then remind some note and tell participants that he has a plan for the evening…e.g., watching a movie and then again says good-bye and immediately he says: “I went through the Minnesotan Good-Bye” and laughs]


## Other point if anything can be included/ optional
### **Nonverbal interaction** [or anything you can think of here]
- [ ] using handshake with feedback (Bevan & Stanton Fraser, 2015) or a verbal command [for greeting] 
- [ ] giving high five [for good news, a positive thing that the participants says]
- [ ] using thinking gesture (e.g., touching his head) when Nao cannot reply or when there are some pauses (to fill the gaps)
