# *Tips for an influential Human-Robot Interaction*

_Older adults want the robot to be companionable and to get along with them as well as their friends and family. They want the robot to go beyond just performing tasks but also to provide them with a feeling of being cared for as well as something that they feel comfortable
having others interact with._

 ## User interface
 **Ensure that user interface is usable by older adults:**
- [ ] Audio: ensure that frequency is within common hearing range of older adults and volume is adjustable so that if hearing impaired the volume can be altered to
ensure clear communication (Stuck & Rogers, 2018)
- [ ] Visual: make sure that guidelines are followed for older adults by providing high contrast, large print, and simple steps for navigation (Stuck & Rogers, 2018)

## Trust  
- [ ] Professional skills:  general capability of the robot, precision, consistency of performance, safety, predictability, and gentleness; e.g., previous experience in a specific task, being on time for medication assistance (Stuck & Rogers, 2018)
- [ ] Personal traits: the material or texture of the robot, the general appearance of the robot, the compatibility of the robot, the congruence of the care provider values with the older adult’s values, the benevolence and kindness of the robot, and how the robot is dressed (Stuck & Rogers, 2018)
- [ ] Communication: Three main communication themes older adults perceive as supporting trust (Stuck & Rogers, 2018)
- Task specifc communication,
- engaging and responsiveness in communication,
- the robot able to both understand and communicate clearly with the older adult


## *Main function categories*
