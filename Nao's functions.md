# *Tips for an influential Human-Robot Interaction*


**Aging** adults want the **robot** to be **companionable** and to get along with them as well as their friends and family. They want the robot to go beyond just performing tasks but also to provide them with a _feeling of being cared_ for as well as something that they feel _comfortable_ having others interact with.

"Much like people like to know what other people are going to do next, similar predictability and transparency will influence HRI." (Rogers & Mitzner, 2017)

"The robot has to provide appropriate information and feedback to the human depending on their role" (Rogers & Mitzner, 2017).

 ## User interface
 **Ensure that user interface is usable by older adults:**
- [ ] Audio: ensure that frequency is within common hearing range of older adults and volume is adjustable so that if hearing impaired the volume can be altered to
ensure clear communication (Stuck & Rogers, 2018)
- [ ] Visual: make sure that guidelines are followed for older adults by providing high contrast, large print, and simple steps for navigation (Stuck & Rogers, 2018)

## Trust  
- [ ] Professional skills:  general capability of the robot, precision, consistency of performance, safety, predictability, and gentleness; e.g., previous experience in a specific task, being on time for medication assistance (Stuck & Rogers, 2018)
- [ ] Personal traits: the material or texture of the robot, the general appearance of the robot, the compatibility of the robot, the congruence of the care provider values with the older adult’s values, the benevolence and kindness of the robot, and how the robot is dressed (Stuck & Rogers, 2018)
- [ ] Communication: Three main communication themes older adults perceive as supporting trust (Stuck & Rogers, 2018)
- Task specifc communication,
- engaging and responsiveness in communication,
- the robot able to both understand and communicate clearly with the older adult

## Cognition features of ageing adults:
- **devided attention**: "Older adults show declines in coordinating multiple tasks"_ so we need to have one clear task/sentence/question in each conversation turn
- **Procedural memory**: "Older adults are less successful in acquiring new procedures"_ it implicates the importance of repitition for them
- **Prospective memory**: "Older adults show decline in remembering to do things in the future, but this is less evident when strong cues or reminders are available"
- **Semantic memory**: "Knowledge acquired over time (e.g., vocabulary and historical facts) shows little decline with age but may be slower to retrieve". _ it guide us that we need to give them time by having some scripts such as "take your time"
- **Working memory**: "Older adults show difficulty in keeping active or manipulating new information in working memory" _ we can provide soe visual info and give them aa summary of key info/depend on the context (Rogers & Mitzner, 2017)

## Nonverbal communication 
- using handshake with feedback (Bevan & Stanton Fraser, 2015) or a verbal command % "negotiations can be more mutually beneficial / cooperative if partners shook hands prior to negotiating."

## *Main function categories*
Preferably, Nao shows some functions/scenarios in following categories (Smarr et al., 2014):
- [ ] Personal care: e.g., assisting with daily needs: comb hair, brush teeth, get dressed, eating, walking, and drinking. Bathing… 
  
- [ ] Leisure activities: e.g., entertainment, social activities, games, hobbies, call family/friends, learn new skills, get information on hobbies, learn to use new technology

- [ ]  Health: e.g., medication management, exercise, calling doctor/911, remind to take medicine  
- [ ]  Chores: e.g., housework, yardwork, cooking, set table, laundry water plant, clean kitchen, control pests, sweep/mop floors, clean windows, make beds, change sheets, take out trash, garden/prune, sort mail
- [ ]  Information management: e.g., reminders (e.g., appointments; daily activities), 
- [ ]  monitoring (home/warns of danger), home, 
- [ ]  finding information such as weather/news
- [ ]  Manipulating objects: e.g., reaching or fetching objects, open/close drawers, finding items

 ## HRI & function evaluation 
 % we can consider these five categories to develop Nao's functions 
- a) "Interface: sound, hand and body movements, face tracking.
- b) Expressiveness: instinctive, lively, natural way of communication.
- c) Responsiveness: speed of reaction, appropriate responses, easy to follow.
- d) Usability: easy to interrupt, easy to know what do next.
- e) Overall: head tracking/movements, enjoyment in interaction"
