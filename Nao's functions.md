# Tips for an influential Human-Robot Interaction

 ## User interface
 **Ensure that user interface is usable by older adults:**
- [ ] Audio: ensure that frequency is within common hearing range of older adults and volume is adjustable so that if hearing impaired the volume can be altered to
ensure clear communication (Stuck & Rogers, 2018)
- [ ] Visual: make sure that guidelines are followed for older adults by providing high contrast, large print, and simple steps for navigation (Stuck & Rogers, 2018)

## Trust
Three main communication themes older adults perceive as supporting trust (Stuck & Rogers, 2018): 
- [ ] task specifc communication, 
- [ ] engaging and responsiveness in communication, 
- [ ] the robot able to both understand and communicate clearly with the older adult

## *Main function categories*
Preferably, Nao shows some functions/scenarios in following categories (Smarr et al., 2014):
- [ ] Personal care: e.g., assisting with daily needs: comb hair, brush teeth, get dressed, eating, walking, and drinking. Bathingâ€¦ 
  
- [ ] Leisure activities: e.g., entertainment, social activities, games, hobbies, call family/friends, learn new skills, get information on hobbies, learn to use new technology

- [ ]  Health: e.g., medication management, exercise, calling doctor/911, remind to take medicine  
- [ ]  Chores: e.g., housework, yardwork, cooking, set table, laundry water plant, clean kitchen, control pests, sweep/mop floors, clean windows, make beds, change sheets, take out trash, garden/prune, sort mail
- [ ]  Information management: e.g., reminders (e.g., appointments; daily activities),
